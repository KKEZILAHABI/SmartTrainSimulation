#  2. Git & Git LFS (everyone)

### Install Git(Kama huna)
```bash
https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

### Install Git LFS (only once per computer)
```bash
https://git-lfs.github.com/
```
Then run:

```bash
git lfs install
```
---
#  3. FIRST-TIME SETUP (When you clone the project)

### 1 Clone

Use VSCode GUI or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KKEZILAHABI/SmartTrainSimulation

cd SmartTrainSimulation
```
### 2 Verify LFS is active
```bash
git lfs env
```
### 3 Open project in Unity
 - Open Unity Hub
 - Click Open
 - Select the project folder
 - Wait — Unity will rebuild the Library/ folder automatically

---

# 4. WORKFLOW

###  A) What to do on EVERY new work session (subsequent pulls)

- Pull → Open → Work → Test → Commit small → Push

---

###  B) While working

- Keep commits small and clear:

---

#  5. Do NOT Commit

Already ignored by .gitignore, but remember:

- Library/
- Temp/
- Build/ / Builds/
- Logs
- Local user settings
- Generated solution files

And:

 No builds
 No temporary exports
 No personal Unity config

---

#  6. Team Rules

 Avoid two people editing the scene at a time
-  Use prefabs for shared objects
-  Pull before starting work
-  Test before pushing
-  Don’t change Unity version alone
-  Communicate big changes early
